Hi, my name is Gaby and I'm a senior economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. I am an adjunct researcher at the the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. My research interests include immigration and the labour market, particularly areas of skills mismatch among migrants, and human capital accumulation. 

I am an appointed member of the board of the [International Education Association of Australia](https://www.ieaa.org.au/). I am the current President of the Young Economists Network (Victoria branch). 

In my spare time, I enjoy riding my bike and going for a surf. Isolation due to COVID-19 has helped me rekindle my old love of playing piano, and revisit some old frustrations like learning Python. I once co-edited a  (micro-)famous blog called [Econlolcats](https://econlolcats.tumblr.com) with fellow co-conspirator [Mike Pottenger](https://twitter.com/Mike_pottenger).
